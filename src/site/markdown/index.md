# Goals

Boombox is targeted to be(come) an extensible, cross platform and open source audio player written in Java. It is (one of) my pet project(s) and I have the following motivation to write it:

From a functional perspective:

- I want random play or shuffle modes on large playlists to play songs that I haven't heard for some time.

- I want plugins to be able to provide a custom GUI

From a technical perspective:

- I want to learn and experiment with technologies and frameworks that are new to  me, such as:

    - Java 9 and modularity

    - JavaFX

    - Audio playback
